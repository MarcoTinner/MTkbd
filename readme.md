# Keys/Keyboard Library for ESP32

## Overview
This is a simple keys/keyboard library for ESP32 allows you the capture single key strokes, chord key strokes, long and multiple strokes of the same key and key pattern entry.

This is mainly aa simple but usefull library for handling keys on simple projects. Don't get you expectations to high, it's not one of those fancy stuff but helped me to keep the key stuff in my projects simple and maybe helps others too.

## Settings
You can set the used key IO pins as array and active high or low in the begin function.
You have several possible settings for bounce timeout, double click timeout, default pattern mode key and timeout for start / end pattern mode, as well as the maximum characters allowed in a pattern.
